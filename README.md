# Feature Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Workflows

This repository contains a collection of workflows for analyzing the [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) (COVID-19) genome. Its main purpose is to compare the features of these workflows and thus provide a high-level overview.

The comparison can be found in the [workflow-overview.md](workflow-overview.md) file.

We invite **anyone** to contribute to this repository and to correct, extend, or improve the feature comparison table!
